  <h2>Our Mission Statement:</h2>
    <p>  <font size = "3"> Do you remember the awesome closet system owned by the main character Cher Horowitz,
      played by Alicia Silverstone, in the 1990s cult classic Clueless? Our team
      has decided to carry out that legendary closet idea to help solve a recurring
      problem in our society.  In this project we concocted a virtual closet organizer
      to refrain people from buying repeated/excessive items. Our idea was to  layout
      a website where people can personalize their own closet by logging in their garments in an inventory by filtering them by size, color, material, occasion, and etc. With this, people can know what they have specifically in their closet without having to buy the same or similar products, wasting money, material, and causing someone in a sweatshop to make that specific garment. We are  dedicated to improving working conditions and supporting the empowerment of workers in the global garment industries who work under these horrible working conditions are treated unfairly.
      Through the purchases we make, we have the power to create an economy where child labor
      and sweatshops cease to exist.  Through our voices and actions, together with others,
      we can help encourage companies here and abroad to ensure that all workers are
      paid fairly and treated with respect. By taking one of these minuscule steps,
            we can make a real difference. So here’s to Cleaner Closet!</font></p>

she quickly learned that it is so much more than that “geeky computer programing” stereotype.
Priscilla always wanted to pursue something in the technology field, and after
completing this program she is more eager to start her career in the computer science field.
